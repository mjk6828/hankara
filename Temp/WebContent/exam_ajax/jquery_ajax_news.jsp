	<p id="news_1">I am honored to be with you today at your
		commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never
		graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever
		gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories
		from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.</p>
	<p id="news_2">The first story is about connecting the dots. I
		dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed
		around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.
		So why did I drop out?</p>
